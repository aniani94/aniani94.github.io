		<p> This page is created to give some information about me. As a form it looks like a CV. </p>
		<p>A CV is a written document like any other, which means it only serves its purpose by being read, it only gets read if it is in an easy to read format.</p>
		<p>The purpose of your CV is to collect together all your achievements and experience and display them in a condensed, well presented format that will entice an employer to give you an interview slot.</p>
		<p>Think about it from the employer’s point of view with every single word you part with. Every sentence must answer a question, serve a purpose and justify the space it takes up on your resume and the employer’s time to read it. </p>
		<p>Right with your ideal target in mind and you will not stray far wrong from your objective. </p>
